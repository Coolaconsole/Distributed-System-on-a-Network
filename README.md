# Distributed-System-on-a-Network
Copy of coursework repository for Controller and DStore implementation on a network.

This project was to create a Controller and DStore class as part of a distributed storage system.
It supports communication with multiple concurrent clients sending store, load, list, and remove requests. Each file would be replicated R times across the DStores.
The client would be provided by the university for testing.

The Protocol defines the messages sent between client, controller, and stores.
